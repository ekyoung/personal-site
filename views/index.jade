    p.
      I built this site mostly as a hobby. Yes, I am a big enough nerd to want to build a website
      on the weekends for fun.

      h2: a(href='/trips') Trips
      p.
        This section contains pictures from some of the trips I've taken. Most of them involve skiing
        and motorcycle touring: my two main hobbies.

      h2: a(href='/about-this-site') About This Site

        Anyone interested in how this site was built can get some information in this section.

      h2: a(href='/resume') Resume
      p.
        I'm a software developer specializing in the MEAN and Microsoft stacks. I'll keep my resume up to date when
        I'm actively looking for a job, but it may be out of date most of the time.
